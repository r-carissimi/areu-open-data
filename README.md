# 🚑 AREU Open Data
This is just a collection of some (hopefully) useful data about [AREU](https://www.areu.lombardia.it/), the agency that coordinates ambulances in Lombardy, Italy. Sadly, AREU does not share any remotely useful data to analyze, just here to fill the gap.

The data inside `real-time-data` is scraped from the official website using [a little script i wrote](https://github.com/r-carissimi/areu-data-collector).
